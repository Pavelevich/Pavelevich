## Focus Areas

- Local AI tooling and model operations (Ollama, hardware-aware workflows)
- Security automation and auditing systems
- CLI-first products with strong developer experience
- Blockchain infrastructure and privacy tooling (especially Solana)

## Current Work

- Expanding reliability and production tooling around local AI runtimes
- Shipping benchmark-driven features for model selection and routing
- Building privacy and observability utilities for blockchain workflows

## Working Style

- Build fast, test hard, document clearly
- Prefer measurable improvements over vague optimization
- Ship practical tools that save engineers real time
